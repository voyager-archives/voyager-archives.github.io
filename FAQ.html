            <h3>What is a Space Simulation Center?</h3>
            <p>A Space Simulation Center, or the Space Center as it is commonly called, is any one of futuristic spaceship flight simulators created by various companies. These simulators, built in real life, allow you to take on the roles of a starship crew, and fly out to negotiate with aliens and battle with pirates.</p>

            <p>The Space Center opened in 1990 at Central Elementary School in Pleasant Grove, Utah.  It's creator and director, Victor Williamson, thought of the idea while taking his students in Young Astronaut Club to a conference in Japan.  Through several years of effort, writing letters for grants, and receiving permission from School Administrators, he was able to start construction.  An addition to the school was built, and the Space Center began with The USS Voyager as its flagship</p>
